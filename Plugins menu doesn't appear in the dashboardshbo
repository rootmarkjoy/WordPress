The issue is almost certainly related to one of two things:

1) You don't have permissions (are you logged in as admin?)

OR

2) The theme (or a plugin) has disabled the plugins menu.

After you've checked to be sure that you are an administrator, then you should attempt to view this page:

http://www.yourdomain.com/wp-admin/plugins.php (replacing www.yourdomain.com with your site's domain name).

If it's accessible, then it's time to start exploring the theme (which theme are you using?) and possibly some of the plugins that might have disabled the menu item.

FYI, the method to remove dashboard menu items add below code into your “wp-config.php” file:

define('DISALLOW_FILE_MODS',true);            ------>   (Make sure both rules should be false not true)
define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT',true);

If above code is used then replace with below code,

define('DISALLOW_FILE_MODS',false);
define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT',false);
